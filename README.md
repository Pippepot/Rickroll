# Rick Roll

This project installs a service, which opens internet explorer every 30 seconds and plays Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley

## Instructions
1. Download the project
2. Run InstallRickRoll.bat as administrator
3. The service should now be installed


To uninstall the service, run UnInstallRickRoll.bat as administrator

## Changing the timer
If you have made any changes to the program, you can build it and find the RickRoll.exe in the bin/release folder. Replace the RickRoll.exe in the root folder with your new .exe file.

## Caveats
1. The first time you open internet explorer it prompts you to accept something. If you have not resolved the prompt, the prompt will be shown instead of rick.
2. Youtube might prompt you to do something aswell, stopping rick from singing.
3. The only browser that can be opened with this method is internet explorer.
